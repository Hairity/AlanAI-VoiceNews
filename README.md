## Alan AI Voice News


Project made with Alan AI where you can use voice commands and Alan will read news to you. You can pick news from different sources and can ask for news by category. He
also can make small talk and answer simple questions. Main focus is on reading news which we get from news API.

What I learned: React, Hooks, API and my first time working with Alan AI(that was fun, because you have a lot of options).
